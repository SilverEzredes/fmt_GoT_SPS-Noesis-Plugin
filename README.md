# fmt_GoT_SPS-Noesis-Plugin
A plugin for Rich Whitehouse's Noesis to import and export Ghost of Tsushima `.sps` textures.

# Installation:
- Download via `Code -> Download as ZIP`
- [Download Noesis](https://www.richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php&showproject=91)
- Extract
- Navigate to your `[Noesis Installation Path]/plugins/python` folder and put `fmt_GoT_SPS.py` in there
- Re-launch the program or select `Tools -> Reload Plugins`

Opening a .sps file with Noesis will automatically load it, once the plugin is installed.

## Usage
- Export `.sps` to either `.dds` or `.tga`
- Edit the texture.
- Save the texture as either `.dds` (if you are saving it as a dds make sure that the compression format matches the one in the Noesis Debug Log) or as `.tga` (32bit)
- Open your texture in `Noesis -> Right Click -> Export -> Select .sps` (in the Main Output Type dropdown menu)
- Select the **original** texture in the popup dialog.
